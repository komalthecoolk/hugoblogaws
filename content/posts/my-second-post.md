## Testing The Second Post

This is **NOT** the first post, and this is *emphasized* text.

Which is a lot of words to say, I found a lot of problems… er, opportunities over on the Azure side of the house! Things weren’t broken (well, some things were), but more frequently what I wanted to do wasn’t possible in the current iteration of the provider. For instance, data sources exist for a single iteration of a resource, but not for finding several resources that match search parameters.
